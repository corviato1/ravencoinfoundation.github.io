# Proposals

Add proposals with a filename format of
[Display name].[IPFS content identifier].txt

You can add a description in the file that may be used in the future, but currently unused.

Anyone can create a proposal, and suggest that it get funded. Because it is being placed on the Ravencoin Foundation website, the proposal will be evaluated before inclusion in the same manner that a PR would be evaluated before acceptance.  Use pull request for your proposal.  Other options like [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) are also available to you.



# Current Proposed Proposals

-Create an issue (right with the project that needs to be improved/fixed/built)
-We can add a funding comment (from the Ravencoin Foundation), or anyone else that can fund the issue.
-The funded proposals need to be aggregated somewhere on the website. The website isn't easy to update, so it needs to be a database or Google Sheet that can keep track of the progress.
-The foundation could just aggregate all the funding proposals and their status

Something like gitcoin, maybe gitRVN could keep track of issues and who's working on them, and update a database on open, pending, status, completion, paid, etc.
